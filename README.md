# PyRTC (Python Real-Time Clock project)
#### This is my first Real-Time Clock project.
#### It can have some problems like compatibility, complexity, etc.
#### Please give me a feedback of RTC.py so I can fix and improve in the later version.
#### Just download RTC.py and run the program.
### I recommend using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with Python 3.13 or higher version that has been installed.
